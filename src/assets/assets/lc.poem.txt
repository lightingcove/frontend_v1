Long for a tide to turn the ship around.
I shalt not stop it nor I must not.
Generous is not what people use on me.
Hungry is what my apettie for money.
The coming hunt for treasure is unimaginable.
I shalt build the best vault in my cove.
Neither a shelter nor a cottage will fit my wealth.
Go and find all the trace of my beloved currencies.
Collect gold and coins is not what I need,
O, it is my undeinable craving for power and status.
Vacancy will be no more in me,
Either should you not be.
